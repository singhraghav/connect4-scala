On a high level the problem that has to be solved is
    1. Game needs to continuously display something in the UI and consume user input for the next steps
    2. Game can quit when user choose to quit

* so we need something like a loop which can be stopped when we reach a terminal state

Games looks to have 3 major mode in which user will have different flow of events and each mode seems to have its own set of fields/state

If we have to visualize:
    - it should have a Menu Mode - [Menu has its own views and its own set of options to choose from]
    - it should have a Game Mode for the ongoing Game - [Game renders its own views , shows its own options]
    - it should have a Pause Mode - [Pause mode essentially opens the menu where user can either resume or decide to start a new game or quit]

* On a high level each mode has only 2 functionality
   1. render the current state
   2. Process user input
